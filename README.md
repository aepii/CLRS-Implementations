# CLRS Algorithms Implementations

This repository contains my algorithms and data structure implementations from Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein's book **"Introduction to Algorithms"**.

I am implementing the algorithms and data structures in **Python**, **C++**, and **JavaScript**, aiming to deepen my understanding of core algorithmic concepts and their application across different programming languages.

## Project Structure:
- **/python**: Python implementations
- **/cpp**: C++ implementations
- **/js**: JavaScript implementations
